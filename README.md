# Cricket_Swing_Visualization

This project aims to explore the science behind the art of swing balling in cricket. The project involves computing the trajectory of the cricket ball using high-performance vectorized code in Python by solving a set of differential equations associated with the motion of the cricket ball, and then visualizing the swing of the cricket ball for different initial conditions. The visualization of the swing of the cricket ball for different initial conditions will provide cricket enthusiasts with a deeper understanding of the game and its mechanics, making the project both important and informative.

Outline: The things we are planning to explore during the course of the project are - 
1. The set of differential equations to describe the motion of a cricket ball can be taken from the work of C.J. Baker as follows
2. Write high-performance vectorized code in Python to solve the differential equations and compute the trajectory of the cricket ball.
3. Implement a visualization technique to plot the trajectory of the cricket ball and analyze its swing for different initial conditions.
4. Fine-tune the visualization technique to provide better insights into the science behind swing bowling.

Deliverables:
(1) Code to take in the initial conditions of the ball and solve the differential equations and determine the cricket ball's trajectory. 
(2) A visualisation setup to 3D plot the path of the cricket ball and examine how it swings under various starting conditions. 
(3) A GUI for the purpose of automating the entire process.

Timeline: Following would be the the rough timeline of the project
Week 1-2: Coding a naive(unoptimized) algorithm for solving the differential equations involved in the problem
Week 2-3: Using techniques and packages learnt in the course to optimize the code for faster implementation.
Week 4-5: Working on visualization of the results obtained by the algorithm and fine tuning the technique for visualizing the swing.
